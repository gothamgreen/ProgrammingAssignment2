# create a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the vector
# 2. get the value of the vector
# 3. set the value of the mean
# 4. get the value of the mean
# line 1 (function declaration) creates a function called "makeVector", which takes one argument and coerces it to be numeric. Everything that follows is part of this function.
# If I understand, calling "test <- makeVector(someVector)" CREATES an environment where m and x are stored. And you can access the values in that invisible environment using things like test$getmean(). That's what they're calling "caching"--accessing some environment where there are name/value pairs, such as m and x, that are in memory from when that original line was called. And you can alter and access those name/values with things like test$getmean() and test$setmean(example_mean) and the other two functions in the list also. Remember though, the only output of makeVector is a list of functions (function handles?), but you can access the environment with m and x in it through that object.
# Except for the last line, "list(...)", in makeVector, the order of content doesn't matter, I believe. It's just getting those functions defined. It's a list of definitions. The order of lines in cachemean, on the other hand, very much matters. 
# Don't mix up the "x" in makeVector and the x in cachemean; they refer to different things. You might already know that, but it's annoying to keep straight at first when this pair of functions is given to you and you're trying to sort everything. "m" and "mean" both show up multiple times too, so just keep straight what they're referring to.
makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
	# initializes the variable "m" as a NULL. That is to say, it clears any values from "m", so you don't have to worry about some leftover value getting introduced into your function.
	m <- NULL
	
	# creates a sub-function called "set", which takes an argument "y".
	# You might wonder why the function set is included, since cachemean doesn't call it. It's for, hypothetically, if we wanted to have our same object, "test", after having already done "test <- makeVector(someVector)", and keep it but just store/cache a different set of name/value pairs associated with it, namely a new vector, and flush the mean.
	# There's some miss understanding on what you state above: y is not undefined; it's the value passed when calling x$set (In which case x is reset to this value, and the mean value m is "cleaned" by assigning NULL to it).
	set <- function(y) {
		# is part of the "set" sub-function, and sets "x" to "y" within the whole function "makeVector", not just the sub-function.
		# from TA: <<- will look for a variable starting at the scope of the parent and going to the global environment.  So it does not require that variable getting assigned to be actually in global().  In the makeVector instance, it is actually finds variables in the scope of when the function was created.
		# the times you see that double arrow symbol in makeVector, those are just defining those functions, not making any calls to try to make changes in other environments. However, cachemean uses the <<- to make assignments, when it calls x$setmean(m), because that's actually calling and using the function setmean, which contains <<- in it.
		x <<- y
		# also part of "set", initializes "m". This makes sense because you are telling the function that you made a new vector (which likely has a different mean, a.k.a. a different "m").
		# The first m<-NULL assignment above initializes the var. The 2nd assignment cleans it's value in case you change the initial vector.
		m <<- NULL
	}
	
	# creates a sub-function called "get", which reports the value of x.
	get <- function() { 
		x # return the current value of x in the environment (lexical scope) of when the function was defined
	}
	
	# creates a sub-function called "setmean", which <strike>uses the built-in "mean" function to get the mean of x (no idea how, I assume it automatically takes x as an argument because of the parent function).</strike> It then assigns the result of the mean function to "m". EDIT: tried to strikeout the old. After some more examination, I believe that "setmean" actually works mostly through its interaction with the cachemean function, which applies mean() to the vector data before using setmean to assign a value to m.
	# the "proper" use of setmean() appears to be that of an "internal" function.  You override the purpose of cachemean() if you call setmean() directly.  So if you want the mean of 1:4 to be 400, then that's how you do it!  But that is a matter of data integrity and security, not R
	setmean <- function(mean) { 
		m <<- mean
	}
	
	# creates a sub-function called "getmean", which reports the value of "m".
	getmean <- function() { 
		m
	}
	
	# create the list itself. For each element of the list, I believe that the part before the "=" indicates the name or key to be used to call that item, and the part after identifies the item (in this case, the sub-function) that the name or key will call. I don't know if or why this part is necessary.
	# Note that makeVector is only useful when you use it to assign a variable.  That variable you assigned with makeVector is now an instantiation of a makeVector closure (i.e. when you call makeVector, you instantiate a closure containing the functions set, get, getmean, setmean)
	# e.g.
	# xx <- makeVector()
	# yy <- makeVector()
	# xx and yy are two separate instantiations of makeVector closures
	# xx$set(1)
	# yy$set(2)
	# Now, xx$get() and yy$get() will pull the "x" variable from their own unique closures
	list(set = set, get = get, setmean = setmean, getmean = getmean)
}



# calculates the mean of the special "vector" created with the above function. 
# However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. 
# If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. 
# Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.
# retrieves m from the cache, which either turns out to be the initiated value, NULL (remember?) if this is the first time we've run cacheMean on it, OR it will be an actual stored mean. So cachemean tests which of those it is. If it's a mean, it goes ahead and returns it as the answer using return(m). If it was NULL, it skips the "if" section and gets the original vector that we put into makeVector, calculates the mean of it right then and there, AND THEN STORES IT IN THE CACHE using x$setmean(m), which, as you can see in the definitions of setmean, assigns the actual mean to the variable m IN THE ENVIRONMENT from when we first called makeVector, using <<-. The cache is associated with the object "test" (from my previous post), and that object must be referenced to retreive things from the cache, such as in calling test$setmean(some_number) in the command line, which is the same thing as x$setmean(m) in cachemean. Another example is test$getmean() in the command line, which is the same as x$getmean() in cachemean. Any time we make make a call of a function that has "<<-", we're trying to make a new assignent in a non-local environment. And when GETTING something from that environment, we don't need "<<-", but we have to reference "test". 
cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
	m <- x$getmean()
	if(!is.null(m)) {
		message("getting cached data")
		return(m)
	}
	data <- x$get()
	m <- mean(data, ...)
	x$setmean(m)
	m
